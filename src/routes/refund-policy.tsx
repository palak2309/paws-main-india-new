        <p>
          AutoAudit Technologies Private Limited (“AutoAudit”, “we”) provides enterprise SaaS software for financial controls, disbursement audits, and leakage detection. This Subscription & Refund Policy governs all billing cycles, plan upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and refund evaluations.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">2. 14-Day Free Trial & Evaluation Period</h2>
        <p>
          We encourage prospective enterprise customers to evaluate AutoAudit risk-free:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>New workspaces are eligible for a <strong>14-day full-feature trial</strong> to test accounting connectors, run duplicate disbursement scans, and verify ROI before any paid subscription commences.</li>
          <li>No long-term commitment or automated charge occurs during the active trial period unless explicitly authorized by the Customer.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">3. Cancellation Terms</h2>
        <p>
          You may cancel your AutoAudit subscription at any time directly through your workspace settings or by submitting a written notice to <a href="mailto:billing@autoaudit.app" className="text-primary underline">billing@autoaudit.app</a>:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Monthly Subscriptions:</strong> Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current monthly billing period. You retain uninterrupted access to your audit registers until that date.</li>
          <li><strong>Annual Subscriptions:</strong> Cancellation prevents auto-renewal for the subsequent annual term. Access remains active through the contracted prepaid annual term.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Technical Failure / SLA Inability:</strong> If the platform experiences verified persistent technical downtime exceeding our 99.9% uptime SLA, or is unable to synchronize due to platform-side defects unrectified within 14 business days of formal notice, customers are entitled to a pro-rata refund for the unexpired portion of the paid period.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing Discrepancies:</strong> Duplicate charges or incorrect billing tier calculations reported within 30 days of the invoice date will be refunded in full to the original payment method within 5–7 business days.</li>
